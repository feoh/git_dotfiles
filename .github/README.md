# My New Deliberately Craft Dot Files!

In the past, I had another [repository](https://github.com/feoh/dotfiles) for dot files. I only used it sporadically because I 
didn't actually have a solid sense of how to store things that only apply *everywhere*.

Now I do. Rather than trying to achieve some kind of mythical set of comprehensive dotfiles
I use everywhere. I'll ONLY put things here that I know will follow me no matter where I go
- like my [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) configuration and some aliases I commonly use.
